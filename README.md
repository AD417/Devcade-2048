# Devcade 2048
Classic 2048, ported to the Devcade gaming system. 

## Currently implemeneted

- Basic controls and movement
- Merge behaviour
- Current score
- Recent score changes
- Blobs.

## Stuff to implement:

- Win screen. (The blobs are ruining everything)
- A method of restarting.
- Main menu
- Credits
- More themes (Eg: Original 2048 theme)
- An actually monospace font, because I hate it when the score bounces around
